About
-----

A general prototyping, training, and testing harness for pytorch used
for models developed under the **ArtIMis: Multi-physics/Multi-material
Applications** and **ASC-PEM-EADA(Enabling Agile Design and Assessment)**
projects.

The YOKE module is divided into submodules, installed in a python environment:

- datasets/
- helpers/
- models/
- metrics/
- losses/
- utils/
- utils/training/
- utils/training/datastep/
- utils/training/epoch/
- lr_schedulers.py
- parellel_utils.py

Helper utilities and examples are under `applications`:

- harnesses
- makefilelists.py
- filelists
- normalization
- evaluation
- viewers

NOTE: Data for training is not housed within YOKE. The data locations are
specified through command-line arguments passed to the programs in
`harnesses`, `evaluation`, and `viewers`.

Installation
------------

The Python environment is specified through the `pyproject.toml`
file. YOKE is meant to be installed using `flit` in a minimal python
environment. We recommend a vanilla python virtual environment.

Setup your base environment and activate it:

```bash
>> python -m venv $HOME/<yoke_env_name> python=3.11
>> source $HOME/<yoke_env_name>/bin/activate
>> pip install flit
>> cd <yoke_repo_clone_directory>
>> flit install
```

Alternatively, one can do a developer install, which allows editing in the `yoke` clone
and includes testing dependencies, with

```bash
>> flit install --symlink --deps develop
```

An alternative to building your Python environment for a particular computing
environment is to use containerization. This allows for portability and some
degree of isolation from the host system. You can then develop a Yoke
application on one system and easily move it to another for larger training
runs etc.

Using the Docker runtime, build the container (this could be done as part of a
CI pipeline) and drop in to an interative shell:

```bash
>> cd <yoke_repo_clone_directory>
>> docker buildx build -f docker/Dockerfile . -t yoke
>> docker run -it yoke /bin/bash
```

When you want to push your application to a different machine or deploy to a
service like Kubernetes, RunAI etc., you can run `docker push` or
`docker export` along with any transfers of necessary training data.

Using the Charliecloud runtime, build the container and drop in to an 
interactive shell:

```bash
>> ch-image build -f docker/Dockerfile . -t yoke
>> ch-convert yoke yoke.sqfs
>> ch-run -d -W --unset-env="*" --set-env \
    --bind $PWD:/mnt/workspace --cd /mnt/workspace \
    yoke.sqfs -- /bin/bash
>> pip install .
```

Testing
-------

To run the tests use ...

> **NOTE**
> A developer install is recommended for testing. Otherwise you'll have to also install
> `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`, and `coverage` in your python environment separately.

```bash
>> pytest -Werror
>> pytest --cov
>> pytest --cov --cov-report term-missing
```

You can look in `.github/workflows/yoke_install_test_lint.yml` to see exactly what
the github-CI runs.

To generate an HTML coverage report use:

```bash
>> pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

Linting
-------

The `ruff` linter is used in `YOKE` to enforce coding and formatting
standards. To run the linter do

```bash
>> ruff check
>> ruff check --preview
```

You can make `ruff` fix automatic standards using

```bash
>> ruff check --fix
>> ruff check --preview --fix
```

Use `ruff` to then check your code formatting and show you what would
be adjusted, then fix formatting

```bash
>> ruff format --check --diff
>> ruff format
```
